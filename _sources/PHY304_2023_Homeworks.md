# Homeworks and formative assessments
Roughly every two weeks, you will be given an exercise, which should be attempted by the following week. 
The purpose of the homeworks is to help your revision of the lecture material and to give you practice in problem solving.  
Two of the exercises are assessed homeworks, which must be handed in the following week.  These will be marked (the total homework mark counting 15% towards this module), and will be returned to you, with comments, before the next homework is set.  The other exercises are no less important to your understanding of the course, and should also be attempted seriously.  Solutions will be provided two weeks after each non-assessed exercise is set.


In this unit we introduce the elementary particles of the Standard Model, we introduce the units used to measure quantities in particle physics, and we recap the rules of relativistic kinematics. 

## Homework 1. Due on 21 October
This homework will assess Unit 1 and is made of two questions on relativistic kinematics. 

### Question 1. Two body decay (5 marks)
Consider the decay $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ in the pion rest frame. Evaluate the energy of the muon in the pion rest frame.

\[Mass of the pion ($\pi^+$) is 139.6 MeV/$^2$, mass of the muon ($\mu^+$) is 105.7 MeV/c$^2$, and the neutrino ($\nu_\mu$) is masseless \]


### Question 2. Production of a a new particle (5 marks)
Electrons of energy 4.00 GeV are incident upon stationary target protons and a search is made for neutral particles $Q^0$ produced in the reaction

$$e^- + p \rightarrow e^- + p + Q^0$$

What is the maximum mass of $Q^0$ which can be produced?  Use any reasonable approximations, but justify your arguments. Make clear which statements you make are generally valid, and which are specific to the case of maximum $Q^0$ mass.

**Hint** Consider how the three particles will appear in the centre-of-mass frame in the special case of $Q^0$ being at its maximum mass. And remember that $E^2 â€“ p^2$ (whether for an individual particle or a system of particles) is a Lorentz invariant, so it has the same value in all frames of reference. Use this to relate the initial state in the laboratory frame to the final state in the centre of mass frame.  

\[Mass of electron is 0.511 MeV/c$^2$;  that of proton is 938.3 MeV/c$^2$.\]
